## Why IDE Extensions Matter to Us

At Hack Club, we all have our own personal set of IDE extensions! Some of us have them for additional custom functionality, others use them to create a more enjoyable coding environment. This versatility helps us everyday, whether we're a few hours deep into development, or we're taking a quick break to refine our focus, we can always turn to our extensions for help!

## Mixing Productivity with Creativity

Extensions aren't just about hardcore productivity - some of the best ones are delightful little additions that make coding more fun! A perfect example is the **VS Code Pets** extension - a virtual pet that lives in your editor and keeps you company while you code. üê±
